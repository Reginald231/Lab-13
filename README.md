# Lab-13
The goal of this assignment is to reinforce hash tables in C++. Specifically, the lab is to implement a dynamic has table where the collisions are stored in a array of lists. Please use table2.h and test_table2.cpp. 

Note: This lab assignment is used in order to provide an insight into data collision in hash tables.
